GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control to facilitate collaboration on software development projects. It allows developers to store, track, and manage changes to code, and collaborate with others on projects, even remotely. Essentially, GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories, offering features like code sharing, issue tracking, and project management tools. 
When you upload files to GitHub, you'll store them in a "Git repository." This means that when you make changes (or "commits") to your files in GitHub, Git will automatically start to track and manage your changes.
There are plenty of Git-related actions that you can complete on GitHub directly in your browser, such as creating a Git repository, creating branches, and uploading and editing files.
f you're new to GitHub, and unfamiliar with Git, we recommend working through the articles in the Start your journey category. The articles focus on tasks you can complete directly in your browser on GitHub and will help you to:
Create an account on GitHub.
Learn the "GitHub Flow", and the key principles of collaborative working (branches, commits, pull requests, merges).
Personalise your profile to share your interests and skills.
Explore GitHub to find inspiration for your own projects and connect with others.
